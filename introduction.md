We present an environment for analysing restricted data using open
software.  The system is described using an analysis of the historical
association of suicides with drought in Australia; and extrapolate
this under climate change and adaptation scenarios.  These tools were
assembled to allow users to access restricted data in a manner that
protects confidentiality of sensitive data, whilst also allowing use
of open software for reproducibility. 

Recently restrictions on access to confidential health records have
increased, especially for  sensitive data on suicide used in our
case study.  Previous solutions to this challenge make access 
so restricted that usability is compromised. We aimed to build a
collection of tools for the conduct of many types of health and social
science research. The starting point for users is the data catalogue,
which provides for finding data available from the store of
unrestricted and restricted data for approved use. Once data are
discovered, the researcher has capacity to manipulate the datasets on
the secure server. The PostgreSQL database integrates and Geoserver
visualises, while statistical tools are available in the R-studio
server browser.

Such analytical tools will enhance the
ability of adaptive management practitioners to assess the potential
influence of adaptations.  The use of the system shows the ease with
which multiple data sources (some restricted) can be analysed in a
secure way using open software.  This will build capacity to answer
complex research questions and compare multiple climate change
scenarios or adaptation assumptions; achieving simultaneous vision of
potential future outcomes from different standpoints.
