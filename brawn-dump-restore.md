TODO make sure you tune the performance on target machine
[as per these instrctions](http://stackoverflow.com/a/2095283).

shared_buffers (1024 or 2048) should be set correctly, maintenance_work_mem (uncomment) should be increased during the restore, full_page_writes uncommented and set to should be off during the restore, wal_buffers should be increased (from -1) to 16MB during the restore, checkpoint_segments should be increased (from 3) to something like 16 during the restore, you shouldn't have any unreasonable logging on (like logging every statement executed), auto_vacuum should be (uncommented and ) disabled during the restore.

#### Code:brawn-dump-restore
    su - postgres 
    createdb ewedbbackup
    psql -d ewedbbackup -U postgres  
    CREATE EXTENSION postgis;  
    CREATE EXTENSION postgis_topology;  
    # make sure the users are all there     
    \q      
    # now dump and restore via a pipe. 
    # important to make sure database and users/permissions exist on target server first.
    # also that source server is in iptables and pg_hba.conf on destination
    
    /usr/pgsql-9.2/bin/pg_dump -U postgres mydb  | psql -h destination.ip.address mydb
    # password is postgres on database at destination
