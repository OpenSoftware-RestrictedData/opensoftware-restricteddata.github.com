## NB This is a test!
I am in the process of rewriting the original document into these web-pages.
Please see "Version 1" link on left side bar for the document as of early 2013.
Current work is availale from the "Site map" link ont the sidebar, with pages that have not been transferred yet labelled as "TODO".

## The Rationale: 
The reason this site exists is because analysing restricted data (such as on human health) is fraught with security issues that hamper statistical analysis and subsequent evidence based policy.

An important concept for modern applied statistics is the Replication Standard [as originally described by King 1995](http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/420301) and called for by [Peng in his 2011 editorial for Science 'Reproducible research in computational science' (334;6060)](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/334/6060/1226.full).  

Increasing concerns over privacy in Australia and globally, combined
with the risk from hacking and the accidental release of large-scale
data sets is leading to increased restrictions on the use of
confidential, highly sensitive health data. This is coincident with
increased statistical and computational power, with the potential to
glean many new insights from already collected data. Unfortunately,
however, the two trends risk cancelling each other out. It is thus
imperative that universities and other institutions who have access to
large data sets manage them in ways that maintain organisational and
public confidence in their integrity.

We demonstrate that with the appropriate IT Infrastructure this can be achieved even in cases where the source data used in analyses are restricted.  The pages of this site presents the design and development of a Virtual Laboratory
for analysing restricted data using open software.  These tools were
assembled with the aim to allow users to access restricted data in an
appropriate and safe manner whilst allowing use of open software to
enhance reproducibility and accessibility.  The system implementation
is described specifically for the [Australian National Research Cloud
provided by the NeCTAR group](http://www.nectar.org.au/research-cloud/).
